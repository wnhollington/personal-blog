This privacy policy governs the manner in which the Colorado Journal of Construction Law collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from readers (each, a “Reader”) of the https://www.cjocl.com website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by this Site.

## Personal identification information

We may collect personal identification information from Readers in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Readers visit our site, subscribe to emails we send through MailChimp and Feedburner, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site. Readers may be asked for, as appropriate, name and email address. We will collect personal identification information from Readers only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Readers can always refuse to supply personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities.

## Nonpersonal identification information

We may collect nonpersonal identification information about Readers whenever they interact with our Site. Nonpersonal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Readers’ means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the internet service providers utilized, and other similar information.

## Web browser cookies

Our Site may use “cookies” to enhance Reader experience. A Reader’s web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Readers may choose to set their web browsers to refuse cookies, or to alert them when cookies are being sent. If they do so, some parts of the Site may not function properly.

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor had visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

## How we use collected information

This Site collects and uses Readers’ personal information for the following purposes:

    To personalize Reader experience. We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Readers as a group use the services and resources provided on our Site.
    To improve out Site. We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from Readers.

## How we protect your information

You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal or security purposes.

## Sharing your personal information

We do not sell, trade or rent Readers’ personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding Readers with our partners for the purposes outlined above. We may use third-party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending out newsletters or surveys.
